the screens still dont communicate, but input does communicate with the og panel. rewrite a prompt focusing on the og panel doing all the heavy lifing

Thanks for the detailed feedback! It sounds like the communication isn't fully syncing as intended. Here's what we can adjust:
Issues to Address:

    Display Window Not Updating: The display window is showing a static message and not receiving updates.
    Central Hub Not Logging or Updating: The hub is not displaying the real-time logs.
    Input Window Logging as Plasma Notifications: The input is being misdirected, likely because the output is sent to an incorrect TTY (or pseudo-terminal).

Adjustments:

    Fixing Input and Communication: We'll redirect the output from bos.INPT to the correct TTY (the original hub terminal).
    Ensuring Real-Time Updates for the Display Window: We'll add the proper communication mechanism to ensure the display window reads and updates based on the hub’s output.
    Ensure Hub Logs to Itself: We’ll fix the logging so the original Konsole window logs directly.

Solution Breakdown:
Step 1: Identify the Correct TTY

In the bos_input_handler.sh, we need to direct the output to the correct TTY (the hub’s Konsole window). First, determine the TTY of the central hub using the command:

bash

tty

Run this command in the main hub Konsole window to see the correct TTY (e.g., /dev/pts/2). We’ll then use that TTY to direct communication from bos.INPT.
Step 2: Update bos_input_handler.sh:

We’ll now send user input directly to the identified TTY of the hub.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Capture the hub's TTY (replace with the correct one)
hub_tty="/dev/pts/2"  # Update this to your actual hub's TTY

while true; do
    # Capture user input from the input window
    read -p "bos.INPT:<< " user_input

    # Send the input to the hub's TTY
    echo "$user_input" > "$hub_tty"

    # Check for 'exit' command
    if [[ "$user_input" == "exit" ]]; then
        echo "Exiting input handler..."
        break
    fi
done

Step 3: Update bos_main_hub.sh (Central Hub):

We’ll make sure the hub logs the input and sends the necessary message to the display window.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Central Hub for managing both windows and handling communication
echo "Central Hub started. Launching input and display windows..."

# Open the input and display windows
konsole --profile bos.INPT --hold -e ./bos_input_handler.sh & disown
konsole --profile bos.DISP --hold -e ./bos_display.sh & disown

# Function to log actions and events to the hub window
log_to_hub() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "[HUB LOG] $message"
}

# Start the main loop for communication and logging
while true; do
    # Capture input from the input window (this should be redirected to this TTY)
    read -t 1 current_input

    if [[ -n "$current_input" ]]; then
        log_to_hub "Received input: '$current_input' from bos.INPT"
        current_input_processed="Processed input: $current_input"

        # Send processed input to display window (this will be shown)
        echo "$current_input_processed" > bos_display_data.txt
    fi

    sleep 1  # Wait before checking for updates again
done

Step 4: Update bos_display.sh (Display Window):

We will make sure the display window reads from the bos_display_data.txt file that the hub writes to.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Disable user input and hide the cursor
stty -echo
tput civis

# Function to display content from the hub
display_content() {
    clear
    echo "□ Title Block (Placeholder)"

    for i in {4..19}; do
        echo "□ Content line $i (Placeholder)"
    done

    echo ""
    echo "□ Menu line 20 (Placeholder)"

    # Read processed input from the file written by the hub
    display_log=$(cat bos_display_data.txt)

    echo "□ bos.DBUG:>>"
    echo "□ bos.CTRL:>> $display_log"  # Display the message sent by the hub
}

# Continuously update the display window
while true; do
    display_content
    sleep 1
done

# Restore cursor visibility and input when the script exits
trap "tput cnorm; stty echo" EXIT

Key Changes:

    Correct TTY Redirection: The bos_input_handler.sh script sends user input to the correct TTY of the hub.
    Centralized Log File for Display: The hub writes processed input to a log file (bos_display_data.txt), which the display window reads and shows.
    Real-Time Logging in Hub: The hub now displays logs directly in the Konsole window as expected.

Test Plan:

    Run bos_main_hub.sh and ensure both windows launch.
    Check if input in bos.INPT is sent to the hub, logged, and reflected in bos.DISP.
    Verify if the display window updates based on the input from the hub.

Let me know how this works!

-----------my notes below:
- updated file tree, consistent naming scheme:
├── bosCORE.txt
├── bosCTRL.sh
├── bosDISP.sh
├── bosAXIS.sh
├── bosINPT.sh

ok so here the existing code, i took some time to think about it and i want to apporach this ina more consolidated way.

simplified logic of scripts:
- bosAXIS.sh
-- this receives the command from bosCTRL
-- launches 2 other windows
(loops here until 'exit' command)
-- waits to receive next input from bosINPT window
-- when it receives a signal, it outputs the new display to bosDISP
-- displays what the program is doing, debug logs, and user inputs each on a new line, continously printing like a receipt of activity (this solves a lot of debugging and logging issues downstream, there is no need to save any of this data as we can capture and debug in real time)
(repeats loop here)
-- bosAXIS will be the centeral hub for formatting later. it needs to hold the functions that receive data from other tables for menus and the functions for content. this should do all the translating, so display is just printing. ideally this is the script we spend most of our time editing after nailing down funcitonality.
- bosCORE.txt
-- long term data storage, uneeded right now, remove all functionality from this
- bosCTRL
-- sends signal to AXIS to do its thing, prevoius called launch bosctrl
- bosDISP
-- prints whatever is sent to it
-- waits for received signal from bosAXIS
-- user should not be able to type here
- bosINPT
-- receives input
-- sends it to bosAXIS

konsole window logic:
- window 1
-- this is the konsole for which i execute the original run command, and will be used for debugging and logging of events, our program should take it over and start issues command through it to the other windows
-- receives data from inpt, runs it through functions, and outputs the data to the display function that should send data to the display
- window 2
-- usr.INPT:<< is in this window
-- takes whatever the user inputs after pressing enter and sends it to window 1
- window 3
-- displays printed data

* one note: the display shell might not be nessecary, might be better to loop it into INPT since these two scripts really serve the same function of managing across windows, with acis doing the lifting of processing the data.


this is just my suggestion, i am open to rewriting in any direction. lemme know what you think :D


current bug list:
- display doesnt refresh
- entereing in 'exit' doesnt close wither window
- the first column should have an EMPTY space to pad the data visually
- i assume the content lines printed but they dont have any placeholder text for debugging





current bugs:
- it isn't a bug but you made a new temp file for display, anything that is temporary should be inputed into the original konsole that launched the two other windows, and that same original window can then send the data to print the DISP window.
- exit is not working
- i dont see any functionality from the third window. i do not like this direction. please run down our options and the things we've done, and i think we might need to find another right lest we become sunk in our cost. i dont see evidence that we're closer to having these windows talk

ok when we switched course to tmux you mentioned we would have TWO windows, and in one of those windows we would do input and the toerh would be display. i only wanted to use tmux in the first window that handle input so we can also do logging in debug in the tmux pane. since our switched we lost most of the functionality we had built before, so i'd like to start building that back in.

my idea was this: our original window is also handling user input and doesn't populate window 2 until the user hits enter. after enter window 2 will print the results from the functions executed from window 1, pane 1. window 1 pane 2 will show all the deubggigng and log messages.

Good afternoon:D
i got somer perspective on yesterday and i'm ready to start fresh, laser focused, and today i will not let our scope creep for an inch!
our current file tre below:
├── bosAXIS.sh
├── bosCORE.txt
├── bos_display_data.txt (i deleted this, please only use bosCORE for this type of thing)
├── bosDISP.sh
├── launch.sh
└── scrap

right now our konsole window shows 3 panels, bottom left pane: Input (this needs to be display), bottom right pane: Auxiliary (this should be input) and finally top left pane: Logging (this should be logging and program out, in other words this box shows all logs, what the program is saying to the user, and what the user last inputted.)

i want to only do the following with this prompt:
- change the names of the panes to match our desired goals.
- update file structure (do we even need to write data to a text file in this new set up?

i want to make sure we're cleaning up any erounous code. right now i'm only focus on us mastering tmux and making these panels appear consistently, and receving data and sending it correctly




column 1 and 89 should always print a blank empty space for padding


this is a theory question, please dont try to produce a snippet, just help me learn: so right now we're adding to our existing code. when or how do i think about moving to creating new content that fits into existing code.



notes:
- i'm concerned at your directoin of keep tracking of the users input. it would be easier to run a check on what the current menu is nest under and go up one level, i dont want to track the user jumping around, i just want to navigate upward



(deck@steamdeck base)$ tree

└── scrap

4 directories, 6 files

above is the current file structure, please adjust the scripts as necessary, note that launch.sh is in the same directory as bosAPP that is now our main folder for anything for the app. i nested bosFILE and bosPAGE as requested.

i want to make sure launch does the follwoing:
launches the program, and then is the thing that handles the printing of data. so all other functions can just send either 'title' data, 'display' data, 'menu' data and 'ctrl' to be printed, and then receives inputs and sends them back to the functions. since this script is sort of handling all of the printing, what we make out side of here can be all functionality, correct?

as for the menu.sh, i'd like to use this file to eventually grow to house an advanced visual menu screen and a screen saver. right now it just allows the user to navigate to other pges

the page_manager does what we intended. do i have a good handle on this plan and modularzation?




we completely lost the formating we had nailed down before:
line 1 empty, always
line 2 title line (title on left side, version v0.4 on the right side of the line)
line 3 empty, always
lines 4-15
line 16 empty, always
line 17-19 menus
line 20 empty, always
lines 21,22,23 are bos.INPT:<<, only print the bos.INPT on the first line and allow the users input to wrap to lines 86 and 87
line 24 empty, always

we lost the 1st column spacing. i'm pasting the old script, but please keep this new modular function while restoring how the text was laid out.

done

so if i understand correctly, since this worked, i no longer need to edit launch? it should always display data correctly as its now more of a clear function?

ok we're so close but i think i'm getting confused in some of our logic soo i want to go through and refine what we've made so it makes more sense. i also updated file names to make them more accurate and in line with formatting.
first the fire tree:
root
├── bosAPP
│   ├── bosBASE.sh (the printer)
│   ├── bosPAGE (folder, driectory for all created pages (pages should be created as .sh files so they can contain functions))
│   │   └── bosLOGS.txt (this just keeps a log of existing pages and should be used for debug logs)
│   ├── bosPMGR.sh (page creation script)
│   └── bosSYST.sh (system settings page)
├── launch.sh (combines all scripts into functional program)
└── scrap (i take notes here, ignore)

ok i have a better understanding now of what we should do to make this function better and i'm going to outline each file below, please note the new names and directory structure above. i want you to respond with one snippet at a time, in the order they appear from the directory above, so we can createa and edit our files carefully.

launch.sh
- this script should open the application
- it loads all the necssary scripts below in the following order
-- bosBASE.sh
-- bosSYST.sh
-- bosPMGR.sh
-- points to relevant directories

bosBASE.sh
- this should be the printer that functions by doing the following
-- respects the previously outlined formatting
--- title on 2nd line, with version number
--- lines 4-15 display
--- lines 17-19 menus
--- lines 21-23 bos.INPT
--- all other lines not listed are empty for spacing/padding
- this script waits for user input, then prints whatever functions were activated by our inputs. our program works in such a way that the user can only enter a single prompt or action, so any function sending data to bosBASE should just print, or i guess bosBASE should print whatever it receives. so if we transition pages it prints all the page data from the txt. if we input something and the page does need to change, it refreshs the print showing only the chnages need (for example pretend we have a 'edit page name' fucntion, after the user does change the page name it refreshse and pulls the proper page data and what not)


bosSYST.sh
- a hardcoded page to edit the program. it should still be formatted to display like other pages, so our functions in the bosBASE do not need to change. so we need to remember our default template notated below.
-- right now it only has one page, which is:
--- page


bosPMGR.sh
- will create and edit pages


#--{'page code'}--
#meta data for our program below this line
#below this line put the program directory (this just tells the program how files are nested, we are not doing any file management on my computer, they can all stored inside the bosPAGE folder)

#below this line is the parent of this page

#put page code below this line

#begins display data
#put title below this line

#put display lines below this line

#put menu list for page below this line (shows what is considered 'nested' below this, check directory in this same file)
##--{end of 'page code'}--


sample of system settings .txt for meta data
#--{'syst'}--
#meta data for our program below this line
#below this line is the parent of this page
menu>syst
#below this line show chidren (we only have one now, separated by ,)
syst>page,

#put page code below this line
syst
#begins display data
#put title below this line
System Settings
#put display lines below this line
{nothing right now}
#put menu list for page below this line (shows what is considered 'nested' below this, check directory in this same file)
page, (nothing else right now)
##--{end of syst}--

i hope this is more stremlined. i know thats a lot, so please, one file at a time. i've created all the files,i think, but please add debug logs that will print in the bosLOGS so we can track our progress.


   .vcm



 we're super close. this edit changed some things in a small way, please try and keep the functionality but adjust it to follow this sample of the print:
---{top of screen}---
1 padding, handled by pad function
2 loads title of page (only on main menu, loads version)
3 padding, handled by pad function
4 DISP
5 DISP
6 DISP
7 DISP
8 DISP
9 DISP
10 DISP
11 DISP
12 DISP
13 DISP
14 DISP

16 DISP last line
17 padding, handled by pad function
18 menu
19 menu
20 global commands
21 padding, handled by pad function
22 bos.CTRL:>>
23 BOS.inpt:<<
24 padding, handled by pad function
---{bottom of screen}---

---{top of screen}---

 Main Menu                                                                       v0.4

 .exit, .back, .menu

 bos.CTRL:>> Invalid input. Try again.
 bos.INPT:<<
bos.INPT:<<
---{bottom of screen}---

note: bos.INPT:<< is showing up twice, and the users text is position at the bottom one. PLEASE make a mental note that this is being printed twice nearly every snippet. from the print it appears that line 19 did not print, as the function finished printing after line 18, we have to make sure menu always prints two lines, the second black if the first doesn't wrap down. otherwise the function is good



ok i want to build the following, and it is super imporant that we try to NOT edit bosBASE. if we have to edit this file it means we failed in being modular (which is ok, we can fix it) but i want to defintley try and separate that file from what we're about to make.

i have created bosPMGR.sh to hanle 1) the page data to display for this page, since it alayws present in the program. 2) it should not do any editing of the print job. ideally it sends what needs to be displayed to the user to the functions in bosBASE, this is an entirely separate file (that is apphended to bosBASE after launch)
do you have any questions?

you've changed a file name without alerting me and has gotten us confused. i never wanted to get rid of bosBASE.sh but i think you changed the file name to bosBASE.sh to be bosBASE_main_menu.sh and how we're confused and need to take a step back and start fresh with what we learned. Please reference the past snippets i complimented you on, note the functions that prefromed well, and try and apply that to the logic below.

3 directories, 8 files
you created two bases, we need to reduce our file structure and compleixty as outlined below. i'm going to include some snippets from the relevant functions in the spots they need to go for the rewrite.

below is a complete logic and rewrite guide. please ask questoins if you have them before you write code. i want the snippets to be complete snippets, one at a time and confirm when i'm ready for the next.

launch.sh
this file ONLY does:
- loads bosBASE
- loads the rest of the files in such a way they are avaliable to bosBASE but do not function until called
- all debugs should be created here, and it prints them in bosLOGS.text

bosAPP/
-bosBASE.sh
--this file does ONLY
--- it prints the formatted style of:
---- title (dropping all appearnece of version number for now)
---- display
---- menu
---- global menu
---- bos.CTRL
--- it receives this data and send it to relevant function
---- bos.INPT
-- this file handles all the formatting, no other file should worry about that. this file prints like we've insctruced in the past with the correct padding. at the end of this message is a sampe for reference.

-bosMENU.sh
-- this file ONLY handles:
--- what menu to send to the printer
---- if main menu, then pull from a main menu table
---- if syst, pull from system settings menu table (which includes the child page)
----- if page, then pull from page men table
--- always prints global menu
--- houses the functions for all global functions (so the .exit function, the .back function for right now)
--- if this .sh is done right, menus from any page should be fitlered trhough here before heading to the printer

-bosPMGR.sh
-- its empty right now but eventally will house page creation functions

-bosSYST
-- is a page, but hard coded so the app can function. it does not do any printing or formating, but will house future functions to edit colors, and other settings.
-- the menu right now only contains 'page' which is the page code for the page manager (bosPMGR.sh)

-bosPMGR.sh
-- menu code is 'page'
-- opens from system settings menu
-- will eventually house the creating of new pages, editing, and deleting of pages (not the hardcoded ones)
-- all pages created from this .sh will be stored in bosAPP/bosPAGE as.sh files, as they will follow the same template as the hardcoded pages.

-bosTEMP.sh
-- i would like to build a default/blank page as we go so when we get to the page creation function we can have it duplicate this and fill in the details. we are not making this now i'm just alerting you to its presence.

notes:the .exit function should close the entire program, not the page

------{end sample code}------
i hope this logic and these notes are succfiencet to resolve our issue, please ask questions or suggest alternative ideas if you have them. only one snippet at a time, please, until i'm ready for the next.



function 1
- checks if the user inputed a specific page, the loads the page and displays that pages menu

function 2
- if function 1 fails, either start up or the user executed a command

function 3
- if user just started app display main menu text*




ok, i tested and i want to go one bug at a time, we're going to try and only edit a single .sh at a time (is function the right word btw? please help me learn proper bash words. bash me over the head with them lolololololol.)

i want to focus on bosMENU.sh
right now it seems to have default menu items in ways i don't get. what i want it to do is this:
 we need to rework the files tructure so that we have a tree to reference. create a new .txt file titled bosTREE inside the bosAPP/ folder that creates a file tree and tracks the heirearchy of parents and children. i want bosMENU to have the function to create this file if it doesn't exist, and then scan the files to track heirachy. i am open to how to do this, but my idea is that each page will have a comment on near the top, consistently, that our program can read that shows something like this:

main menu
├── syst
│   └── page
└── any other parent directory (currently are none)

another solution could be:
0. main menu
    1. system
        2. page
    1. (future parent directories)


indicating that the main menue is the parent of system settings is the parent of page

bosMENU.sh contains:

tables
1) main menu table
- this table needs to display syst always
- this table also needs to populate with all program root level files. our programs root is defined as bosAPP/)
- this should allow our main menu to show the page options for all parent level directories
3) global table of global commands


- function 1
checks if this is start up, if so display main menu
- function 2
receives user input, pulls new menu from new page to replace default menu. this should then stop the main menu function from being used until the user has gone back to the main menu. to do this we are going to institue a check in this file that allows a global flag for the current active page
- funtion 3
if the user is on a page (for example syst) lines 17 and 18 should now be display ONLY that pages menu (in addtion to the default global menu thats always seen on 19)

on start up we have to create a system in this file that scans the bosAPP folder and builds a new file tree off of the new files, and it needs to read that commented line in them to determine the loading order.






okie doke, that was an unsuccesful test. heres how we're going to adjust:
- i reviewed your script and it does the following (in order)
-- global commands, this is good
-- creating bosTREE.txt is not working at all. i created the .txt file so you can ignore that part of the program, and just focus on editing it. I attempted to copy your pattern as outlined in a previous reponse, as alsop pasted here:
base
 └──syst
     └──page
note that i really want to use the page codes here for brevitiy, note that main menu is supposed to be 'base' as a page navigation aide. i should ALWAYS be able to type 'base' into the input and navigate to the main menu as a global command, this is one of the few global commands not preceeded by a '.'
-- your next function is display menus dynimcally based on current pages
--- i want to veryify that this is going to pull all the menu data from the hardcoded pages themselves. this function SHOULDNT be populating the menu, it hsould just stand as the printer. if the global flag is telling the printer we're on system settings, we should pull the system settings menu information from that specific page (.sh file for it) as opposed to what we have now, hard coding it in.

help me understand if these comments are good or helpful, if so can we go this way?

i wrote them as after the test i noticed that 'page' shows up on every single page, due to its hard coded into the menu. i hae used that word too much, hardcoded. there are some pages that the user can NEVER delete, the system settings and page manager are among them, but we still want to treat them like they are being loaded as separte files. does that make sense?
