to do:

the screens still dont communicate, but input does communicate with the og panel. rewrite a prompt focusing on the og panel doing all the heavy lifing

Thanks for the detailed feedback! It sounds like the communication isn't fully syncing as intended. Here's what we can adjust:
Issues to Address:

    Display Window Not Updating: The display window is showing a static message and not receiving updates.
    Central Hub Not Logging or Updating: The hub is not displaying the real-time logs.
    Input Window Logging as Plasma Notifications: The input is being misdirected, likely because the output is sent to an incorrect TTY (or pseudo-terminal).

Adjustments:

    Fixing Input and Communication: We'll redirect the output from bos.INPT to the correct TTY (the original hub terminal).
    Ensuring Real-Time Updates for the Display Window: We'll add the proper communication mechanism to ensure the display window reads and updates based on the hub’s output.
    Ensure Hub Logs to Itself: We’ll fix the logging so the original Konsole window logs directly.

Solution Breakdown:
Step 1: Identify the Correct TTY

In the bos_input_handler.sh, we need to direct the output to the correct TTY (the hub’s Konsole window). First, determine the TTY of the central hub using the command:

bash

tty

Run this command in the main hub Konsole window to see the correct TTY (e.g., /dev/pts/2). We’ll then use that TTY to direct communication from bos.INPT.
Step 2: Update bos_input_handler.sh:

We’ll now send user input directly to the identified TTY of the hub.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Capture the hub's TTY (replace with the correct one)
hub_tty="/dev/pts/2"  # Update this to your actual hub's TTY

while true; do
    # Capture user input from the input window
    read -p "bos.INPT:<< " user_input

    # Send the input to the hub's TTY
    echo "$user_input" > "$hub_tty"

    # Check for 'exit' command
    if [[ "$user_input" == "exit" ]]; then
        echo "Exiting input handler..."
        break
    fi
done

Step 3: Update bos_main_hub.sh (Central Hub):

We’ll make sure the hub logs the input and sends the necessary message to the display window.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Central Hub for managing both windows and handling communication
echo "Central Hub started. Launching input and display windows..."

# Open the input and display windows
konsole --profile bos.INPT --hold -e ./bos_input_handler.sh & disown
konsole --profile bos.DISP --hold -e ./bos_display.sh & disown

# Function to log actions and events to the hub window
log_to_hub() {
    local message="$1"
    echo "[HUB LOG] $message"
}

# Start the main loop for communication and logging
while true; do
    # Capture input from the input window (this should be redirected to this TTY)
    read -t 1 current_input

    if [[ -n "$current_input" ]]; then
        log_to_hub "Received input: '$current_input' from bos.INPT"
        current_input_processed="Processed input: $current_input"

        # Send processed input to display window (this will be shown)
        echo "$current_input_processed" > bos_display_data.txt
    fi

    sleep 1  # Wait before checking for updates again
done

Step 4: Update bos_display.sh (Display Window):

We will make sure the display window reads from the bos_display_data.txt file that the hub writes to.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Disable user input and hide the cursor
stty -echo
tput civis

# Function to display content from the hub
display_content() {
    clear
    echo "□ Title Block (Placeholder)"

    for i in {4..19}; do
        echo "□ Content line $i (Placeholder)"
    done

    echo ""
    echo "□ Menu line 20 (Placeholder)"

    # Read processed input from the file written by the hub
    display_log=$(cat bos_display_data.txt)

    echo "□ bos.DBUG:>>"
    echo "□ bos.CTRL:>> $display_log"  # Display the message sent by the hub
}

# Continuously update the display window
while true; do
    display_content
    sleep 1
done

# Restore cursor visibility and input when the script exits
trap "tput cnorm; stty echo" EXIT

Key Changes:

    Correct TTY Redirection: The bos_input_handler.sh script sends user input to the correct TTY of the hub.
    Centralized Log File for Display: The hub writes processed input to a log file (bos_display_data.txt), which the display window reads and shows.
    Real-Time Logging in Hub: The hub now displays logs directly in the Konsole window as expected.

Test Plan:

    Run bos_main_hub.sh and ensure both windows launch.
    Check if input in bos.INPT is sent to the hub, logged, and reflected in bos.DISP.
    Verify if the display window updates based on the input from the hub.

Let me know how this works!
